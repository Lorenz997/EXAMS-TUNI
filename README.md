# EXAMS-TUNI
Some "newer" exams that I have took, I hope this will help younger TUNI-students when preparing for an exam. 

All these exams were done remotely on Moodle/TEAMS etc. because of the virus-situation so some exams might be a bit different than "normally".

**Table of Contents:**

- ASE-2411 Johdatus systeemien hallintaan
    - Exam done remotely. 
    - The file includes my answers also. Got 28.5/50 points. 
    
- DEE-23030 Sähkömarkkinat
    - Remote exam. 
    - The grading was in this exam "pass/fail" for everyone. 
    - My answers are there also, I got a "pass"-grade.
    
- DEE-23017 Control of Electrical Drive Systems
    - Remote exam.
    
- DEE-34306 Numerical Modelling of Electrical Machines

    - On a normal exam there would most likely be an explanation of different terms on the first part like what is dirichlet boundary condition etc. This time the explanation          task couldn't be made becouse remote exam and google :D
